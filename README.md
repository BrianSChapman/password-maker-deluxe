## Usage

When the page is opened, click the Generate Password button. You should be prompted to choose a password length and whether you would like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters in your password. Upon clicking on all the options, a password should be generated on the page for you.

- CSS Tricks : https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/select-random-item-array/

- W3 Schools : https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp & https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp 

I also utilized my peers and study materials to try and better understand how to approach this.
