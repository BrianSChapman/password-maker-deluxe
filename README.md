## Usage

When the page is opened, click the Generate Password button. You should be prompted to choose a password length and whether you would like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters in your password. Upon clicking on all the options, a password should be generated on the page for you.

## Credits
 
To better understand some of the functions and loops needed to get this up and running, I touched on a handful of websites:

- geeksforgeeks
- CSS Tricks
- Stack Overflow
- mdn web docs

I also got advice from my peers in study group.
